# Sylvain Simao―@maoosi

>>> 👋 Hey! I’m Sylvain Simao, CTO @Travis. Most of my experience is at the overlap of technology and creative thinking 🤯. You can see some of my work for Airbnb, MARS, Amazon and many other clients on [my personal website](https://sylvainsimao.fr).

## 🥾 Travis Travis?

[Travis](https://travistravis.co) is an early stage Startup and we are currently building a product that focuses on **supercharged storytelling for travel 🧳**. Why supercharged? Because in addition to making it fun for people to create, share and discover authentic travel stories, we also want to make it easy to plan your next trip from the stories that 🧙 inspire you.

### 

I have strong expertise in **leading technical teams**, **designing scalable solutions** for global rollouts, as well as **building digital experiences** that combine usability and creativity.

On my spare time, I like to explore new things through side projects ⚡ and open-source libraries. I also regularly talk about Vue.js and I've been co-organising the Melbourne Vue.js meetup for the past 2 years.
