### Hi there 👋

I’m Sylvain Simao, 🤖 CTO at [Travis](https://travistravis.co). We are an early stage Startup, currently building a product that focuses on supercharged storytelling for travel 🧳.

Most of my experience is at the overlap of technology and creative thinking 🤯. You can see some of my work for Airbnb, MARS, Amazon, and many other client on [my personal website](https://sylvainsimao.fr). I have strong expertise in **leading technical teams**, **designing scalable solutions** for global rollouts, as well as **building digital experiences** that combine usability and creativity.

On my spare time, I like to explore new things through side projects ⚡ and open-source libraries. I also regularly talk about Vue.js and I've been co-organising the Melbourne Vue.js meetup for the past 2 years.
