# 🖖 I’m Sylvain Simao, CTO @Travis.

### What is Travis?

[Travis](https://www.travistravis.co) is an all-in-one platform where travellers can discover, save, plan trips based on visual travel stories and guides. Like Pinterest, built for travel.

### My background?

I am a hands-on technology leader with 12+ years of experience across software development and tech leadership roles, both in France and in Australia. I have strong expertise in driving technology strategy, leading engineering teams, as well as designing and building web applications at scale.

Before joining Travis as CTO, I was Technical Director at [Clemenger BBDO](https://www.clemengerbbdo.com.au/). You can see some of my work for Airbnb, MARS, Amazon and many other clients on [my personal website](https://sylvainsimao.fr).
