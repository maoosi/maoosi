# ðŸ–– Hey!

**Iâ€™m Sylvain Simao, CTO @Travis.**

### What's Travis?

[Travis](https://www.travistravis.co) is an early-stage startup based in Australia and operating 100% remote.

We are building a web platform for people around the world to create, share, discover and save authentic travel stories and local experiences. More than just a tool, we aim to create a product that people have fun using, with a real personality and using storytelling at its core.

### Who am I?

I am a hands-on technology leader with 12+ years of experience across software development and tech leadership roles, both in France and in Australia. I have strong expertise in driving technology strategy, leading engineering teams, as well as designing and building web applications at scale.

Before joining Travis as CTO, I was Technical Director at [Clemenger BBDO](https://www.clemengerbbdo.com.au/). You can see some of my work for Airbnb, MARS, Amazon and many other clients on [my personal website](https://sylvainsimao.fr).
